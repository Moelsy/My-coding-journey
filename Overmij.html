    <!--About me-->
    <section class="container-sm" id="about">
        <!--Deel 1: introductie-->
        <h1>Nice to meet you</h1>
        <p>My name is Elsie.</p>
        <p>I am born in the 90s.</p>
        <p>I recently started working at a tech company where I assist in developing, improving, and implementing software programs for government agencies.</p>
        <p>I'm a very active person, and I'm always looking for new ways to stay fit. 
        I like to go to the gym and be outside.</p>
        <p>
        My interest in tech began during my time at university. 
        After graduating and entering the workforce, I discovered my passion for devising creative and innovative solutions in society. 
        </p>
        
        <p>I like to play guitar to relax.</p>
        <p>I like to read to learn more about life.</p>
        
        <!--Deel 2: mijn routine-->
        <h1>My daily habits</h1>
        <p><i>
            I firmly believe that habits play a significant role in determining the quality of life. 
            With a desire to maximize my life's potential, I adhere to ten positive habits that promote productivity, health, and happiness.
        </i></p>
        <p><b>Choose love: </b>be kind always, because everyone is fighting a battle you don't know about. 
        <p><b>Quality time: </b>spend time with your friends and family. I personally enjoy going for long hikes with my family and cooking with my friends.</p>
        <p><b>Exercise: </b>move your body in different ways. And don't forget to stretch.</p>
        <p><b>Eat healthy: </b>drinks water, avoid junk food, eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.</b></p>
        <p><b>Socialize: </b>meet new people and have fun. I personally love socializing with older people and with people during a surftrip.</p>
        <p><b>Create: </b>I personally love to work on my own coding projects and playing the guitar.</p>
        <p><b>Meditate: </b>Do nothing for 10 minutes. I personally meditate daily and focus on my breath. Not always easy, but it helps to calm my mind.</p>
        <p><b>Learn: </b>I love to learn new things or improve my skills. I try new hobbies, listen to podcast and read books.</p>
        <p><b>Be inspired: </b>re-read quotes and books that inspire you, re-listen podcasts that lift you up. I personally love the podcasts of Lewis Howes from the School of Greatness.</p>
        <p><b>Be present: </b>listen to music, eat slowly, enjoy feeling the sun on your skin or walking in the rain, just observe the world around you.</p>
        <p><b>Rest: </b>Prioritize relaxation and ensure you get sufficient sleep.</p>
